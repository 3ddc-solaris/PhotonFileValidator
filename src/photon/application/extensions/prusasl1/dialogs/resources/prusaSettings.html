<h3>To achieve optimum results, the following settings should be made in PrusaSlicer:</h3>

<div class="note">Please note that the manual applies to PrusaSlicer version 2.2.0. The procedure for other versions may differ.</div>

<ul>
    <li>Go to tab "Printer Settings".</li>
    <li>Select the built-in Prusa SL1 printer profile.</li>
    <li>Switch the view to expert mode (red button in the upper right corner).</li>
    <li>In the section "Corrections" set the field "Printer gamma correction" to <b>0</b>.
        <div class="note">This disables anti-aliasing in PrusaSlicer, as the anti-aliasing settings cannot be applied at the moment.
            However, this is not a limitation, since the built-in calculation in the PhotonFileValidator offers much finer control of the anti-aliasing settings.</div>
    </li>
    <li>(Optional) In the section "Print Host upload" set the field "Hostname, IP or URL" to <b>{URL}</b>
        <div class="note">This setting allows you to send the file to PhotonFileValidator with one click after slicing without having to save and reopen it.</div>
        <div class="warning">{WARNING}</div>
    </li>
    <li>Save the profile under a new name, for example "Anycubic Photon".</li>
</ul>
