# Photon File Viewer
A file viewer application for AnyCubic Photon sliced files (*.photon and *.cbddlp). The viewer can show you preview images, print information and all layers with information on overhang and islands issues.

## Photon files

### What is a Photon file
A Photon file is generated by the AnyCubic Photon Slicer (rebrand of ChiTu DLP Slicer). The slicer takes a 3D object and turns it into a list of images, each representing
one printable layer. The 3D printer then prints each layer by exposing liquid resin with UV light, and lifting the build plate.

The Photon file also contains information about the height of each layer, for how long each layer is exposed to UV light, and some settings for overexposing the first layers to make the print stick to the build plate.

### Why do I want to view a photon file
In the ideal world, - you don't. The slicer makes the file, and the printer used the file to print your object.

But, sometimes prints fail. The Photon File Viewer can show you all the layers and settings stored in the file.

The Viewer can also analyze the file for layers that contains areas that is not supported (printed in mid-air, called islands). Islands are a problem, because the model will not be printed as designed.
In the best scenario the island will stick to the plastic bottom of the printer or attach itself to the printed model, but it could also be trapped between the printer and the model, breaking the FEP or the LCD screen.
